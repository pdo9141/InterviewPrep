--Non-repeatable read example : Open 2 instances of SQL Server Management studio. From the first window execute Transaction 1 code and from the second window, execute Transaction 2 code. 
--Notice that when Transaction 1 completes, it gets different values for read 1 and read 2, resulting in non-repeatable read. 
-- Transaction 1
Begin Transaction
Select ItemsInStock from tblInventory where Id = 1

-- Do Some work
waitfor delay '00:00:10'

Select ItemsInStock from tblInventory where Id = 1
Commit Transaction

-- Transaction 2
Update tblInventory set ItemsInStock = 5 where Id = 1


--Fixing non repeatable read concurrency problem : To fix the non-repeatable read problem, set transaction isolation level of Transaction 1 to repeatable read. This will ensure that the data that Transaction 1 has read, 
--will be prevented from being updated or deleted elsewhere. This solves the non-repeatable read problem.  
--When you execute Transaction 1 and 2 from 2 different instances of SQL Server management studio, Transaction 2 is blocked until Transaction 1 completes and at the end of Transaction 1, both the reads get the same value for ItemsInStock.
